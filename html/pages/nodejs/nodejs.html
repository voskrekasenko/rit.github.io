But the faith of an app</h5><h5 class="margin-fix">decided by how cleverly you develop</h5><h5 class="margin-fix">and execute it.</h5></div></div><div class="understand"><h5>Understanding Node.js</h5><p>Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment for developing server-side Web applications. The software platform is built on Google’s V8 JavaScript engine. Ryan Dahl, the creator of Node.js, targeted to develop real-time Node.js apps with push capability, being inspired by Google apps.</p><p>Node.js has an event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous I/O. These design choices are meant to optimize throughput and scalability in Web applications with many input/output operations, as well as for real-time Web applications (e.g., real-time communication programs and browser games).</p><h5 class="margin-fix">The benefits of using Node.js</h5><h5 class="margin-fix">for business app development.</h5><ul><li>Quick prototyping. The average time for development process is the shortest among today’s frameworks, hence a rapid minimum viable product delivery is for sure on the cards</li><li>Big range of features that can be carried out using this platform.</li><li>Inexpensive to test and deploy using Pay As You Grow services</li><li>Easy to develop software real-time systems</li><li>Easily scalable. It makes extremely easy to prototype (almost) any kind of web application in a short time.</li><li>Universality. In Node.js the code is written in one language, but can be run on multiple platforms.</li><li>Node.js services are lightweight and easy to modify.</li><li>Very cheap hosting for Node.js business applications compared to other apps.</li></ul><h5 class="build-text">What to build using Node.js?</h5><ul><li><h6>Networking applications.</h6>Networking applications. Node provides event-driven, fast, server-side JavaScript run time environment, being an excellent platform for highly scalable social networking apps.</li><li><h6>One page apps.</h6>The ability to process many requests in a limited amount of time with low response times, make it an excellent choice for web applications of today's business that perform lots of data processing on the client side.</li><li><h6>App prototypes.</h6>Great choice for developing business MVPs without wasting resources.</li><li><h6>Node.js mobile applications which communicate to platform API and databases.</h6>Node.js is very suitable to develop apps complying with the latest in mobile app technology Звучит так, что мы можем использовать NodeJS для мобильной разработки. Надо перефразировать.</li><li>Game applications.</li></ul></div><div class="wrapper padding-fix nodejs-second-cards"><h5 class="project-text">Project models.</h5><div class="row"><div class="card-second"><img src="css/img/full-cycle.png" alt=""><h6>Full cycle development</h6></div><div class="card-second"><img src="css/img/service-icon.png" alt=""><h6>Service</h6></div><div class="card-second"><img src="css/img/outstaffing.png" alt=""><h6>Outstaffing</h6></div></div></div></div>
